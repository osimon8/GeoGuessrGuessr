# GeoGuessrGuessr
Final Project for CIS 522 at the University of Pennsylvania.

We present a model to handle the task of determining the location of an image. Inspired by the online game GeoGuessr, we cast this problem as a supervised classification problem: given Google Street View images, the most probable state out of the 50 US states is output.
